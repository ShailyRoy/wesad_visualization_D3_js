                <h2>Introduction to WESAD Dataset</h2>
                <p>
                    The WESAD dataset is a multimodal dataset designed for wearable stress and affect detection. 
                    It includes data from 15 participants aged between 24-35, with a mix of males and females.
                </p>
                <p>
                    • Number of males: 12<br>
                    • Number of females: 3<br>
                    • Dominant hand distribution: 14 right-handed, 1 left-handed
                </p>
                <p>The glyphs in the visualization represent individual participants and are created based on their demographic information, such as 
                    color based on gender, brightness based on age, length based on height, thickness and head size based on weight, and position of hand based on dominant hand. The glyphs are visual representations where each participant is depicted using 
                    a simple figure. The figure's characteristics vary according to these attributes, helping to provide 
                    a visual comparison of the participants. Hover on glyphs to see the details of each participant and Scroll to explore individual participants and their physiological data.</p>
